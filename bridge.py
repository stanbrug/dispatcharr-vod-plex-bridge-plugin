        ever saw them -- e.g. deactivated already, or a folder that predates
        strm_folder tracking -- which those reconcile passes can never reach
        since they only iterate their own tracked-activation dict's keys.

        Reuses scan_orphan_strm_folders()'s existing folder-naming/detection
        logic (folders on disk not referenced by any tracked activation) for
        the disk side -- no persisted "folders we've ever created" ledger is
        introduced, per the user's explicit direction. For each such
        untracked folder (movie top-level folder, or series show-level
        folder), the folder's own name is checked against `catalog_titles`
        (the caller's current live Dispatcharr title set, movies and series
        combined): if the title is still in the catalog, it isn't a
        provider-drop -- leave it alone (that's ycjh's manual panel's job,
        not automatic removal). If it's not in the catalog, treat it as
        confirmed provider-dropped and run it through the same shared
        _remove_title_fully() routine deactivate/reconcile already use --
        one mechanism for both kinds, not a forked series code path.

        Plex-side deletion for both kinds goes through the shared
        _plex_delete_by_title() title-match helper (movies: type=1 against
        movie_plex_section; series: type=2 Show-level against each orphan's
        own category's plex_library_section, resolved the same way
        _plex_delete_episodes() resolves it). movie_plex_section defaults to
        settings["plex_library_section"] (the same source _plex_delete_movies()
        already reads), mirroring how every other movie Plex-delete call
        picks its section.

        dry_run: when True (first-deploy safety default -- see the
        untracked_orphan_dry_run plugin setting), runs this exact same
        detection pipeline for real -- catalog membership check, on-disk
        folder scan, and the live Plex title-match query -- but skips the
        destructive side effects: no shutil.rmtree (via _remove_title_fully)
        and no Plex DELETE call (via _plex_delete_by_title(dry_run=True)).
        Each candidate that WOULD have been removed is logged and appended
        to self._maint_dry_run_candidates (folder kind/name/path + matched
        Plex (rating_key, title) tuples) for the dashboard/user to review
        before flipping to live deletion. Returns [] in this mode, since
        nothing was actually removed.
